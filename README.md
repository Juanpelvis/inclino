Scripts for generating plots for the inclino paper.

I organized it in three folders.
Everything here should be enough to work together as a whole.

The borehole class is what controls everything. It stores the raw data and transforms it using functions found in 'aux_inclino2.py'. Probably 1/3 of all that code is actually useful, so if needed I can trim it down.
